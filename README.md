### Basic Functions:
- Start/Stop: Play using internal clock or external midi clock
- BPM change using encoder
- Loop Start and End points via encoder
- Record:
  - Overtop: using Encoder button
  - On-Play: holding foot pedal, recording starts when first note played. Recording stops with foot off pedal. Automatically cuts loop to nearest beat, so loops nice.
- Clear notes (via encoder button)

### Canon Functions:
- Transpose (to scale, on/off beat, via encoder or key input)
- Phase (by multiples of loop, by amount in steps)
- Frequency (compress note sequence in time, in fractions of current loop length)
- Mirror Notes Pitch (with a user defined mirror plane, reflect notes in pitch axis)
- Mirror Notes Loop (with a user defined mirror plane, reflect notes in time)
- Note Cutofff Filter (mute notes like a LPF or HPF)
- Note Velocity (use finger to draw note velocity or encoder)
- Note Duration (use encoder to increase or decrease all note lengths)

### Additional Features:
- 256 events (not bound by bars or specific steps)
- Polyphonic
- Intuitive scales
