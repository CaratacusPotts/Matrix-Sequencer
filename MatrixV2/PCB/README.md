These files were created in Ki-cad.
Some of the pads are custom and need the footprints tweaking.
On the lower board (base), I don't recall any errors
On the upper board, I messed up on the PNP mosfet footprints(?), and the pins are wrong.  CHECK!!!, otherwise you will be doing what I did on this board and inverting and rotating the mosfets to get solder them.  Pain.
